**Diabetes** is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body processes glucose (sugar) in the blood. 
It occurs when either the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin (a hormone that regulates blood sugar) or when the body can't effectively use the insulin it produces.
This results in elevated blood sugar levels, which can lead to various health complications if not managed properly.

The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning **to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not based on certain medical variables**. 
This falls under **Classication Machine Learning Problem**. This prediction can be valuable for early diagnosis and intervention which can improve the management of diabetes.
